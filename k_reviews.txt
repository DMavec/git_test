Bec is my brothers girlfriend, my friend & housemate, and a remarkable young lady. She has an amazing appetite for knowledge, and an ability to consume books and podcasts at warp speed. Occasionally Ill have a conversation with her about history, science or politics, and find myself wondering how so much knowledge found its way into the head of a 20 year old. 
<br><br>
Bec is eager to help others and she's generous with her time and knowledge. I worked with her on a big project last year and she went well beyond the call of duty to support me. Thanks Bec, I remain in your debt.
<p>Scott Fardy has a wonderful beard, it is black and long and it covers some of the numerous scars he has accumulated over the course of his career.</p><p>Having spent a few years playing alongside Fards at the Brumbies, it's clear that he appreciates all that rugby has given him for having to earn things the hard way.</p><p>Before arriving at the Brumbies, Fards bounced around on the fringes of Super Rugby teams and did a stint in Japan. Unlike many professional footballers Fards has had &#34;real jobs&#34;, working long hoursas a labourer made a mark on Scott, the evidence of which is his tireless work ethic. He is a teammate I loved playing with, because he is as tough as nails, and he has a beard, a black one.</p><p>I also enjoy the way Fards appreciates the entire experience of being a professional athlete. In many ways he is a throwback to rugby players of old, who enjoyed a beer and a laugh every bit as much as anything that happened on the field. Fards has a sense of perspective about rugby that many players would do well to adopt - one that acknowledges the importance of giving a hundred percent, without losing sight of the fact that rugby, at any level, is still just a game.</p><p>Fards, I'm thoroughly looking forward to seeing what you do on and off the field in coming years, including your foray into life as a publican: <br/></p><p><font face="inherit"><img class="ta-insert-video" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/RfkLTDjNjdY/hqdefault.jpg" ta-insert-video="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RfkLTDjNjdY" contenteditable="false" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0"/><br/></font></p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Rath</p><p></p>
<p>Elon Musk embodies the entrepreneurial spirit which says it's not good enough to hope for a better world without being committed to building it. <br/><br/>Musk's vision of the future speaks to our imagination because it's so courageous and audacious that it transcends 'us'. Multi-Planetary life, sustainable energy and an inevitable move into gene manipulation and AGI are exciting today - but they will be incredibly impactful tomorrow. <br/><br/>When we notice someone turning their vision into reality a part of us feels more alive, invigorated, and more open to possibilities. Musk is shaping a future for generations to come, and we intuitively know how important that is.<br/><br/>The anarchist in me also appreciates the way Musk is breaking long established rules regarding the government and the free market. Conventional wisdom dictates that space travel and sustainable energy are domains over which governments will exert control. However Musk is demonstrating that global problems can be tackled without wasting astonishing amounts of tax-payer dollars. <br/><br/>Anytime intelligence, vision and dedication trump stupid, pedestrian &amp; wasteful governments, we move closer to a better world.</p>

I have no hesitation in saying that Monish has exceeded our hopes at every level.</p><p>Yoda (as he's know at Karma's HQ) is a thoughtful, genuinely funny and seriously hard working person. In our many discussion spanning all manner of topics I'm constantly impressed by his intellectual curiosity, commitment to truth and love of knowledge.</p><p>As a non-technical cofounder I've appreciated the patient way Yoda has suffered through my endless list of profoundly ignorant questions.

<p>How does one describe the enigma that is Miss Di Tulip? I met Di in first year uni in Biology. It didn't take long for us to become friends and now I can say that Di is one of the people that has had a huge positive impact on my adult life. </p><p>Di is studying a double degree of engineering and science majoring in chemistry (I know...WOW) and she is by far one of the most intelligent and capable people I have had the pleasure to know. She is one of those people who amaze you every time they open their mouths and I am constantly in awe of how she balances her life and manages to not only pull out insanely good grades but actually learn (a feat that not that many people at university can actually do well).</p><p>Di is one of my best friends and one of the most amazing people I know. She has the ability to not only do well at uni herself and learn but also to encourage everyone around her to do their best and want to be a better person. (Plus can lift weights like a boss) I know she has an incredible future ahead of her and will make an extremely positive impact on the world.</p>
<p>Adam and I met when he was the new kid on the block at school. It must have been the tennis court that we found each other where I did go on and beat him comprehensively for 4 years. Somehow that never got in the way of our friendship and he went to turn the tables, go to Harvard and play tennis at a pretty good level. For me sadly it went the other way...</p><p>Adam is without doubt one of the most fun, loyal, crazy, smart, caring, ambitious people that you can come across. He is the first person I think to call when I have a problem knowing as my best mate he will drop what he is doing and focus on me and my issues whilst he is juggling 10 deals. His insight and diverse thinking always finds me the right answer.</p><p>We live so far apart and yet not a day goes by where I don't miss you brother.</p><p>As a successful venture capitalist Adam is my go to guy in the US and no doubt once Karma starts scaling great heights I will reach out to you for advise for the truly awesome team behind this great startup.</p><p><span>Just know I am equally always here for you!!</span><br/></p>
<p>In the past year Ive had the pleasure of getting to know Meg. During this time Ive learnt that she is as intelligent, creative and funny as she is committed to human rights and the environment.</p><p>Being around Meg is an experience I love. She is the kind of worldly, courageous and borderline absurd person that people gravitate towards. I deeply appreciate her forthright style of communication. She is honest without ever being malicious and is as quick to laugh at herself as she is to zero her wit on others.</p><p>Though Meg has left Canberra I look forward to many more of her brilliant monologues, drunken rambles and genuinely insightful commentary on life.

<p>Though I've known Dario since we were in high school, we've only slowly become closer in recent years. In fact, there was a stage in high school where the prospect of our ever being close seemed unlikely; needless to say, I am immensely grateful that I now find myself regularly enjoying Dario's company, and that we are good friends.</p><p>Dario is kind, humble, and extremely intelligent. He is dearly loved by all of his friends, and brings an unassuming joy and warmth to all of his interactions. Dario is a man of numerous hobbies and interests, but he is particularly drawn to (and excels at) mathematics and games. It's no surprise then that he is a statistician in high demand, and a wonderfully gifted player of (board, card, and computer) games.</p><p>I'm envious of more of his attributes than I would care to admit, but in particular I'm frequently amazed by his calm, rational, and unerringly optimistic approach to life.

Though I havent seen Lawrence in almost a decade I have no doubt that hes still the unassumingly brilliant, kind-hearted guy that I grew up with. Law and I trudged through school and university together, his encouragement and tutorship accounts for my otherwise inexplicable lack of academic failure.
<br><br> 
Lawrence may be an actual genius. I remember arriving at school on the morning of our final year math exam. Everyone was frantically scribbling away, cramming in whatever last minute knowledge they could. Law was bouncing from person to person helping explain the solutions to the problems theyd been unable to solve.
<br><br>
He'd made his usual 20km cycle to school on his BMX that morning, borrowed someone's textbook, and began his first study session for that exam. Hes not lazy, hed just had the kind of life that made prioritising math exams an impossibility.
<br><br>
When I first started working on Karma, Lawrence was the first guy that I wanted to get on our team (Im still trying). He has no experience with web development but Ive worked with Law enough to know that he has the guts, work ethic, and brilliance to excel at whatever task he puts his mind to.
<br><br>
I hereby submit this petition to formally request that Lawrence quit his job, emigrate to Australia, and help us change the world.
<p>Al is one of the best thinkers and contributors I know. He knows how to get the best out of himself and the people around him, and is on track to realise his enormous potential.</p>
Observing from a distance someone  trying to  bring something unique to the world  can only inspire one to make a difference in whichever way we can. Dayne is someone I see who embraces change and who doesn't play in his comfort zone. His diversity of experience will be a massive asset to Karma as will his passion and creativity to try and create something that will truly benefit the world. Watching two brothers  on a team  try and bring Karma to life is positive in itself. The mutual respect between two brothers recognising their individual talents and differences is a message in itself to all siblings out there!!
<p>Chris is the best co-founder/worker/traveler/liver that anyone could want.</p>
<p>Dayne is my little brother and and endless source of entertainment, inspiration and wisdom.</p><p>I could pick from a long list of adjectives to describe Dayne, hes one of the smartest people Ive had the pleasure of knowing, he is intensely moral and kind, but perhaps the quality that most defines him is his courage.Dayne isnt afraid of pursuing his dreams or helping others chase theirs, and his passion for life inspires everyone who comes into contact with it.</p><p>It has been inspirational watching Dayne tackle the challenge of building Karma by bringing all of his talents to the fore everyday. Im immensely proud to call him a brother and I look forward to many years of fun, growth and discovery with him as we work together to realise Karmas potential. I love you boet, Clyde</p>

<p>I met Matt when he arrived at the Brumbies as a wet behind the ears teenager.</p><p>I was immediately impressed by his work ethic and the humble way he applied himself to life as a professional athlete. Knowing the effort that Matt has poured into his job its been a real pleasure to see him establish himself as a world class player.</p><p>It has been equally gratifying observing Pup push himself intellectually. Developing a truly independent mind is one of lifes great challenges, one Matt has taken to with curiosity and healthy skepticism in spades.</p><p>Though Matty is engaged to a woman well beyond himself I know he'll be doing all he can to make up the considerable difference :)</p>

He's one of the most open, generous people I've met and a real one-off. Claytonhas always had a pretty unique take on things. He's an engineer, a seriously talented guitarist and voracious collector of music, a practitioner of Eastern religions but also a keen follower of rugby, film &amp; documentaries, a compulsive traveller and collector of vintage amps and rare guitars. I feel like our wide ranging discussions could go on for days.</span><span style="color: black;">What always stands out is his ability to put aside whatever might be dominating his thoughts or weighing him down and be there to be present and fully engage and offer support, a wry comment never too far away. His sincerity sets him apart as does the phenomenal porridge he makes that slowbakes overnight.</span><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
<p>Anh was the first friend I made after arriving to Australia. She is like the sister I never had, being the person that she is, she took me under her wings and pretty much looked after me. She'd make sure I was fed, introduced me to Vu and helped me find a place to stay when I was pretty much homeless.</p><p>She is very caring and seriously hardworking (no wonder Vu and Anh are such a match). Thanks to Anh I can understand people speaking English with thick Vietnamese accent :P</p><p>I am glad our paths crossed and I am very grateful that you are my friend.</p>
My 11 year old son recently gave a speech about Nelson Mandela. During our discussion on this topic  we discussed the impact this great man has had on South Africa and the lives of so many and the life lessons we can all learn from him . 

The ones we discussed were:
1. Being able to forgive. Even the people who have caused you the greatest harm he had the compassion to forgive and see the bigger picture;
2. Being able to inspire. Mandela was able to inspire people with his vision of the future of South Africa;
3. Being able to lead his people and make very tough decisions along a difficult path; and
4. Being someone that never lost belief and faith. 

These are 4 simple lessons I hope my son has learnt from this great man.

"If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.It always seems impossible until it's done."

I owe much of my understanding of politics, business, and economics to our conversations and debates. <br/><br/>Many people who meet Ivan find him to be highly disagreeable. Hes brutally honest, unafraid to speak his mind, and he enjoys being provocative. He holds some extreme and unusual opinions, and his social skills are, shall we say, &#34;not calibrated for sensitivity&#34;. But where it counts, in his heart and his actions, Ivan is one of the best people I know. Hes completely trustworthy, principled, and an exceptionally loyal and generous friend. <br/><br/>As soon as Id decided to dedicate myself to building Karma, Ivan offered to invest $20,000 on whatever terms I think are fair. He still doesnt really understand what Karma is all about, I think he just wanted to help out a friend in need...</p><p><span>Which I was, and he did.</span></p><p><span>Thanks mate.</span></p>
<p>Josh, or Bongo as hes known to his mates, is one of the happiest people I know. Even as one of the oldest players in the Brumbies squad, Bongo brings an infectious positivity and energy to everything he does.</p><p>It is near impossible to have a conversation with Bongo without feeling better about life - perhaps this stems from simply being around someone who appreciates their good fortune.</p><p>I dont know what Bongo plans to do post rugby, but I know that he will bring great joy to the people fortunate enough to share his company.</p><p>Much Love,</p><p>Rath <br/></p>

Thankfully, my tendency to make bullshit claims in his company continues to wane because he never hesitates to expose me for the fraud that I can be.

He doesnt make a fuss about himself, but instead prefers to highlight the value he sees in others.

Bertrand Russell instigated 20th century philosophy, wrote the book on mathematics and logic, was the only significant public figure to oppose WWI, was a pioneering male women's suffragist, was expelled from a teaching position in an American university for having liberal sexual attitudes, won the Nobel Prize in literature, mentored Wittgenstein, drove the anti-nuclear campaign of the 1950s and 60s, had John Stuart Mill as a secular godfather, started his own experimental school and was for half a century the worlds most prominent public atheist. So yeah, he smashed it.
<p>
The first thing to notice about this sampler of his achievements is that they barely make sense in terms of timelines. How can he have had a guy who died in the 1870s as his godfather, while getting arrested for anti-nuclear protests in the 1960s? He lived for 98 years with unfailing health, is the answer. At one point in his 70s he was in a plane that crashed into the ocean off the coast of Norway, killing 19 people. The largely immortal Russell simply swam ashore, crediting his life to the fact that he insisted on being in the smoking section (he was an inveterate pipe smoker until death).
<p>
The main thing I notice about Russells life is that he was right about the most important things, frequently wrong about the things biographers care about and able to admit mistakes. He was ahead of his time in terms of feminism, atheism and nuclear disarmament; he accurately diagnosed the Stalin regime before most other Western intellectuals; and he was unflinching in his opposition to WWI at a time when everyone was gleefully looking forward to a war, to the extent that he was gaoled for six months. He was also completely discredited in his main professional field, mathematical logic, but freely admitted that his three volume lifes work, <i>Principia Mathematica</i>, was fundamentally flawed and he happily revised his views many times in his 70 year career. Best of all, he was willing to go against the tide of opinion, often alienating himself from friends and colleagues, in pursuit of what seemed like the principles of humanism, liberalism and scepticism. 
<p>
Ive been inspired by Russell. What Ive learned from this wizard-like character is that even though he comes from a bygone age with vastly different moral codes and social norms, his laser-beam analysis of what is good and what is monstrous pretty well holds up today. Sometimes our thoughts stray into areas that are uncomfortable because they clash with the received wisdom of our peers. This is not a reason to dismiss such thoughts; what is good for the world and humanity is not what is conventional.
<p>
His autobiography is essential reading. Heres an amusing clip of an ageing Russell discussing religion: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvg5Kf97Hw<a/>

He<font face="inherit">has an amazing work ethic andis a keen student of the game.</font>Recently departed for France, his never-say-die attitude and heart on his sleeve commitment to enjoying life will be much missed by teammates, friends and family.</p><p><font face="inherit">Though hes now plying his trade in</font>elsewhere,<font face="inherit"> I have a feeling weve not seen the last of him in Australian Rugby and I look forward to catching up with him on his return trips.</font></p><p>Much love,</p><p>Rath <br/></p>

<p><span>Mike is an honorary member of the Rathbones. In 2014 he moved in with me and my family for almost the whole year while we created an insane web series together. Working with Mike is like being strapped to a rocket - you're moving dangerously fast, you'll end up somewhere you never expected, and the journey ends with a bang.</span></p><p><span>We met in 2011 and immediately connected over a shared sense of humor and values, and weve been good friends ever since. Mikes one of the hardest working and most competent people I know - hes a writer, producer, director, actor, camera operator, and editor, and he does all these jobs with incredible passion and skill.</span></p><p><span>Though he's a few years younger than me I look up to him like an older brother. He's full of sage wisdom coupled with a no-bullshit, punk attitude. Think Buddha crossed with Kurt Cobain. He's taught me a lot about how to get shit done, the value of separating planning from doing, and generally how to be a more effective human.</span></p><p><span>I look forward to our next adventure with equal parts excitement and trepidation.</span><br/></p>

<p>Dan is one of my favourite primates.</p><p>Our friendship is founded on the way we see the world. Which is to say that Dan is committed to using critical thinking and reason to navigate his way through life. We share a love of irony, the dialectic, and a deep disdain for authority and dogma.</p><p>Im grateful to say Dan's intellectual curiosity and commitment to truth has spurred me to consider not just what I think, but how I think. I have a huge respect for the way he has carved out an interesting life since his retirement from professional sport, and I'm intrigued to to see what he does next.</p><p>I also very much appreciate Dans ability as something of an energy conservation expert - he is not a man in a needless hurry. Much love, brother.</p>
<p>Rory is my younger brother and one of my best friends.</p><p>I love the way Rory looks at the world. At just 22 Rory is an enlightened young man and one of the happiest people I know. He brings an infectious positivity to everything he does and his innate ability to see the best in the world makes him the kind of person other people love being around.</p><p>I deeply respect Rory's commitment to self-experimentation, to adventure and to discovery. It seems impossible that Rory could lead anything but an interesting &amp; full life.</p><p>Smart, hard working and with a strong sense of values built on what really matters in the world, Im proud to call Rory my brother and friend. Much love, little bro.</p>
<p>Though we haven't met in person I consider Lily a friend. We worked together for about 6 weeks early on in Karmas development - Lily in New York and the rest of the team in Australia. I remember receiving her job application, Googling her name, and stumbling onto some of her very original and provocative artwork.<br/><br/>Is it ok to hire someone I've seen naked I wondered for not very long.<br/><br/>Lily threw herself passionately into her work. She contributed significantly to our core design, UX and UI, and shes almost entirely responsible for all the beautiful touches in Karmas design.<br/><br/>Lily is an exceptionally clear, creative, and objective thinker, and she welcomes feedback and criticism as an opportunity to learn and improve. When we were low on capital and nearing the end of her contract she took it upon herself to work for free on her weekends to finish the job.<br/><br/>In addition to being someone of great integrity and competence, shes just a lovely, fun person to work with.</p>
<p>I first met Byron (aka Bols) in primary school. My earliest memory was him bowling a ball that hit the wicketkeeper squarein the eye. Being the good guy that he is, Byron couldn't stop apologizing and I think he felt worse than the bloke with the black eye! That was to be my first experience of Byron's &#34;great guy&#34; traits - one of many. He's the kind of guy that you could wake up in the middle of the night and ask him to drive 30 minutes into town to come and pick you up from a nightclub after you've been left behind. He'd do it in a flash without any complaints. Although he's a bit older now and has a young family, so maybe there'd be a grumble or two these days, but he'd still do it...</p><p>If I had to sum Byron up ina fewwords, these are the ones that first spring to mind (I could keep going on but will limit myself to 5 for now): kind, reliable, helpful, trustworthy and funny.</p><p>Bols, you've been a great mate for many years and I look forward to many more. <br/></p>
<p>Yesterday I had the privilege of hearing Richard's talk on leadership lessons from a Lion. Richard grew up in South Africa and immigrated to Australia when he was 5 but retained a love for Africa and Animals. He became a tour guide and on one of his tours in a remote area of Botswana he was mauled by a Lion.</p><p><img class="ta-insert-video" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/akM5Yu9WGNY/hqdefault.jpg" ta-insert-video="https://www.youtube.com/embed/akM5Yu9WGNY" contenteditable="false" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0"/><br/></p><p>For a while he blamed the Lion which isn't prone to charging without warning. He blamed lots of people and things as &#34;people don't want to hear about personal responsibility&#34;. It took him a while to realise that blaming others = a permission to fail. Richard finally took personal responsibility that it was his fault for being in that position and rebuilt his life and passion for Africa and Animals.</p><p>I took so much away from Richard's authentic talk. Here are my takeaways for the Karma community to benefit from:</p><ul><li>All leaders have Lions but don't blame them;</li><li>Leaders look for the absolute truth;</li><li>Leaders actively seek ways to own situations; and</li><li>Leaders demonstrate and don't just talk</li></ul><p>Richard talked openly about the moment when people talk about your life flashing before you, when a 140kg female lion is biting into your neck. Its not all the great moments in your life that flash before you...its rather the regrets you have. Richard calls these the GAPS in our lives. He asked us all to reflect for a moment if we were in a Lion moment what would our GAPS/regrets be. The secret in life is to start every day trying to close these GAPS. Its so simple, so true and so profound and can have the most amazing impact on all our lives.</p><p>Richard ended with his own adapted saying:</p><p>&#34;The secret to freedom, the secret to great leadership, the secret to success, the secret to an amazing life...is personal responsibility which requires Courage&#34; Richard 2015 AD</p><p>Richard thank you for sharing your story and reminding me to close my gaps in my life!!</p>

(I just asked Jamie how he would characterise our relationship to  you and he suggested that you're a "dear friend". I thought that was the perfect way of putting it and a perfect way to start this letter. So:)
<br><br>
Dear friend,
<br><br>
You are one of the funniest people in the world. 
<br><br>
It may seem like a strange tack to take, to describe you as funny (rather than as brilliant or strange or kind), but let me explain what I mean by funny before you vote down my letter.
<br><br>
To be funny the way you are funny is to  break and enter into the minds of people, to steal their inner thoughts and to sell those thoughts back to them in a way that doesn't shame but somehow makes whole again. What a rare skill, to know and to understand what makes people feel most vulnerable and to take that and turn it into something delightful. To be funny the way you are funny is to take an idea further than anyone might think possible (or necessary), to take it apart and put it back together again, so that it's exposed for what it is.  To be funny the way you are funny is not to be funny all of the time (to be serious, often) so that when it's time to laugh again it's all the more cosmic for it.
<br><br>
But you're not just funny. You're strange and brilliant and kind too. For another letter, for another time.
<br><br>
With love,
<br><br>
Meg
<p>I've never met Melissa in person, but I'm a fan of the work she does to promote the kind of ideas which are fundamental to human flourishing. </p><p>Melissacurates the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GSHMP/" target="">Global Secular Humanist Movement</a>while working at<a href="https://www.facebook.com/securingchange?pnref=lhc" target="">Securing Change</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org" target="">Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</a>. Melissa's Facebook page is a humorous andfascinating mix of globetrotting, question asking and position taking - all in the pursuit of truth and its fruits.</p><p>In a world riven by ideologies underpinned by ignorance and spread by indoctrination, humanity desperately needs vocal proponents ofreason, evidence &amp; science. In Melissa we have such a person, and I hope Karma is yet another platform for her voice.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>John is the latest addition to Karma team. He doesn't back away from learning new things or shooting hoops. I enjoy talking about AI and Math/Science education with him, the breadth and depth of his knowledge amazes me.

<p>I got to know Dave during the two years we played together at the Brumbies. It didnt take long to be impressed by the values Poey espouses.</p><p>Much more than a world class rugby player, Dave is genuinely committed to using his platform as an athlete for the greater good. Im immensely impressed by his willingness to speak his mind and stand his ground on issues that most athletes avoid. His vocal support of equality in every domain and his passion for environmental causes has earned him friends and enemies to be proud of.</p><p>I deeply respect the work ethic and commitment he showed to overcome two career-threatening injuries, and Im excited to see what he does on and off the field in future.</p><p>Learn more about Dave's charity, <a href="http://www.eightytwentyvision.org" target="_blank">8020 Vision</a>, and checkout his<a href="http://www.davidpocock.com/#intro" target="_blank"> website. </a></p>

She is meticulous about her work, and her passion for her craft is palpable. She is incredibly skilled and a brilliant listener when it comes to understanding what a client wants. She delivers, every time. I simply cannot recommend her enough.</p><p class="p1"><span>Be sure to book in early though, because she's seriously well sought after.</span><br/></p>
<p>Lish gives ordinary people the tools and know how to reduce their carbon footprint in simple and cost-effective ways. Through her amazing business Green It Yourself (http://greenityourself.com.au/) and her captivating skills in science communication, Lish inspires people to not only believe they can change the world, but that they can develop the skills to do it themselves.</p><p>All that brilliance aside Lish is the salt of the very earth and never has a bad word to say about anyone. Seriously. Ever. It's disgraceful. She is genuinely full of good will and faith in humankind (and science). PLus she's completely hilarious and generous and can't wait to hear your stories. She's a natural radio presenter every morning on 666 ABC Canberra, where she pulls together the weird, the amazing and the delicious in one show.</p><p>I was lucky enough to meet her at university before she was famous and although she is far more accomplished some 20 years later, she is the same grounded, kind, gentle and hilarious person she always was.<br/></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Clyde and I had one conversation with Mr Nguyen over Skype and immediately become big fans of his.

You might expect a leader of a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/11/framed-data-seed/" target="">fast growing tech company</a>to be too busy to help two strangers on the other side of the world, but in Thomson's case youd be wrong.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;background-color: transparent;">The conversation turned into a long and interesting discussion about our startup, punctuated with valuable insights and advice, and concluded with a sincere offer by Thomson to help us in any way he could.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;background-color: transparent;">Lily had spoken extremely highly of Thomson, and it's clear to see why. He exudes competence, humility, and compassion, and its obvious that he has a genuine desire to help others.</span></p>
Laingy seems like the kinda guy that would be an arrogant dick - hes tall, handsome, good at sports, and he has a deep manly voice that makes my knees weak (I have gay knees). But like Spiderman, Laingy knows that great responsibility comes with great power, and he's chosen to use his for good instead of douche. 
<br><br>
Laingy is good mates with my younger brothers Luke and Rory. He and I became friends during a month long camping holiday in late 2014. Anyone who's lucky enough to spend time with Laingy soon discovers that he's down to earth, intelligent, quick to laugh, a great listener, and an all round awesome guy to have around. It's been a pleasure getting to know him, and I'm stoked to be his friend.

<p>I think every human on the planet has something to learn from Rory.<span> </span></p><p>The way he thinks is ahead of the game for even the most accomplished primates.<span> </span>He has an uncanny ability to identify the positives in almost any situation without sacrificing an intelligent and critical worldview.<span> </span></p><p>I admire the way he genuinely engages with the people around him and the dedication he has to truly enjoying life.</p>
<p>Ive known Darren since we attended high school in South Africa, and its safe to say that in many ways we grew up together.</p><p>Some of my favourite childhood memories are peppered with Darrens mischievous face. Whether it was running away from bikie gangs, destroying postboxes, doing donuts on the school field or &#34;egging&#34; the girls dorm-rooms, Darren was the type of person you needed on your team. Mainly because he had the rare ability to appear innocent whilst carrying out horrendous crimes against the rules.</p><p>Its been a pleasure to see Darren go from a rudderless university student into a game ranger, and then into a successful environmental consultant, father and husband. Through it all hes retained a loyalty, kindness and sense of adventure that is rare.</p><p>Though long stretches of time apart have punctuated our friendship, whenever reunited were able to pick up where we left off.  Weve been there for each other through some of life's inevitable tough patches, and weve been able to celebrate each others successes.</p><p>In his old age Darren has learnt what matters in life, he is the quintessential family man, happiest around his loved ones and immersed in lifes simple pleasures. Darren, now that youre in Australia we really need to see each other more often. Much love, Clyde</p>
<p>Glynis is my long suffering mother to whom I owe mountains of gratitude.</p><p>In a household containing four sons and an impossibly impish husband I'm not sure how she retained such a firm grip on sanity. Somehow she always found a way to celebrate our distinctly unusual family, and I'm often reminded of her best qualities when I see them expressed in my brothers, and even occasionally, in myself.</p><p>My mother's generosity is matched only by her complete disinterest in any kind of recognition or reward. Never one to mince her words or bite her tongue I can only hope to be as thoughtful, honest and forthright. Thank you for everything, mom. Love Clyde</p>
<p>Liam is my younger brother. Even though he is younger than me, he still amazes me all the time at how intelligent and driven he is for an 18 year old. He is a fantastic musician and has a great knack for science. He has so much raw skill that I know I never have to worry about him because he will do well in anything he does.</p><p>I am very lucky to have him as my brother and I know that everyone who gets to know him will have their lives significantly improved.</p><p>I am looking forward to growing up with him more and seeing what an amazing man he is sure to become. I will miss him a lot when he moves to Melbourne to study physics but I know he will do amazingly well and will always be a huge part of my life.</p>
<p>Alan is my father, which makes me well positioned to assess this weird and wonderful man.</p><p>My dad is the prototypical eccentric creative. He combines genuine curiosity with a reckless pursuit of the path less traveled to lead a full and interesting life. The sense of adventure that my brothers and I share is in no small way connected to my fathers storytelling prowess. We are all better for having heard them and I often wonder if my life is creating equally compelling narratives.</p><p>As a father he was always highly supportive of whatever I chose to do, and he often praised my brothers and I to a fault. As Ive gotten older Ive begun to fully appreciate the numerous sacrifices my parents made for our family.</p><p>My dad is happiest when hes around his loved ones and applying his unusual mind to unusual problems. Thank you for everything, Dad. Love Clyde</p>
<p>Pat was a teammate of mine at the Brumbies for a number of years.</p><p>Pattys arrival at the Brumbies was memorable, but for entirely opposite reasons than one might expect of a future Wallaby. I remember him as a skinny kid who wasnt really anything to write home about. He was not especially athletic or skilful. He was extremely softly spoken and seemed completely out of his depth in professional rugby.</p><p>I remember thinking that Australian Rugby was in trouble if this guy was getting a go. But Pat had different ideas about his ability. He applied himself with complete dedication to every possible area of potential improvement.</p><p>And slowly but surely everything in his game got better. In his totally unpretentious way Pat is all grit, determination and heart. Many people know Pat as the professional athlete who came back from two broken neck injuries before finally retiring after the third. But for all his toughness Patty is equally thoughtful, honest and generous with his time.</p><p>I have absolutely no doubt that he will make a giant success of his life.</p>
<p>Dayne is one of the strangest units I have ever come across, yet is someone I cant help but respect and admire.</p><p>I first met Dayne around 4 years ago to watch comedy clip he had created.<span> </span>The person I was confronted with was either a complete idiot, or a genius - it didnt take me long to be convinced of the latter.<span> </span></p><p>Dayne is now someone I seek out to discuss ideas with, as I know he can be relied on to expose any flaws in my thinking and give me an honest assessment of the issue at hand.<span></span>He is an intelligent human who challenges the status quo and thinks in a rigorous and deep manner.<span> </span></p><p>His uncompromising pursuit of truth, and the courage he often shows to take the weirder and less travelled path, is what I admire most about Dayne.</p>
<p>Luke is an interesting human being who I always enjoy spending time with.<span> </span></p><p>He genuinely cares about others and has an interest in understanding the people around him at a deeper level than most.</p><p>Luke constantly questions his own views and challenges the ideas of others in such a way that is beneficial to all involved.<span> </span>He is someone who can be trusted to provide an honest assessment of any given situation.<span></span></p><p>He is a curious, honest and caring individual who has a structured and rigorous way of thinking that I greatly respect.</p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of working with Matthew over the past few years. He is an extremely gifted speaker and illustrator who happily travels all over the world to share his inspiring story and has since released a number of books on resilience. Matthew is a passionate mental health advocate and openly shares his experiences and knowledge to benefit others.</p><p>I have had Matthew do presentations in schools, in large corporate environments and in sheds in paddocks and each and every time Matthew captivates the audience with his relaxed delivery and genuine nature.

About a year ago I was introduced to Dan Carlin's Hardcore history podcast, specifically the epic series following the mongol empire of Genghis Khan. At the time I was moving house so I had plenty of time to listen and to get hooked. I sped through the hardcore history podcasts and soon moved on to the Common sense  podcasts. 

The thing that makes Dan Carlin's podcasts so fantastic and valuable is Dan Carlin's way of expressing both historical and current events in such a fresh and unique way. He seems incredibly self aware of his biases and fairly balanced in his analysis of these topics. 

I have learnt so much through his podcasts and celebrate whenever a new one comes out. I would recommend them to everyone and although I do not know what he is like in real life, the person delivering the podcasts presents the world in such a way that I don't doubt it inspires many and will lead to great things.
<p>Elesha is one of the bravest and most compassionate people I know. She's fiercely independent and tough, frequently throwing herself out of her comfort zone, and pushing herself well past breaking point (she finished a recent crossfit competition drenched in blood).</p><p>But she also has a heart made of marshmallows. It's hard to imagine Elesha being on anyone's bad books, she takes a genuine care in the well being of others, and she'll happily give you the shirt off her back if you need it. Elesha donates much of her free time to <a href="www.campquality.org.au" target="">Camp Quality</a>, helping to bring some joy to kids living with cancer.</p><p>Thanks for growing Elesha, Universe, she's one of the good ones.</p>
Despite being a West Ham supporter versus supporting a proper North London football team (namely Tottenham Hotspur) I've always had a healthy respect for Kevin's entrepreneurial talents and strategic thinking. Kevin is a big ideas guy, get stuff done, effective communicator, straight shooter and all round good guy - someone who you'd want on your team. Kevin has been responsible for bringing me into the Karma  journey at this exciting early stage. In itself that has to be a positive contribution to the world.
Bec is the partner of our son, Rory.  They've been dating since they were both still at school, about four or five years ago.  She is much loved by the Rathbone family, a kind, loyal, considerate and altogether lovely young lady. <br><br> Bec has an inquiring mind and loves to debate issues  - these cover a wide range of subjects.  She is always respectful of other viewpoints and a great listener. The Rathbone boys are always  up for a debate and in spite of her gentle, easy going nature, Bec is no pushover.  She's  articulate and knows how to stand her ground.  Just as well as the Rathbones are an exuberant bunch. <br><br> Bec is hardworking and conscientious. Whatever path she travels she will always give nothing but her best.  She is the best.
<p>Jeremy and I have known each other for about six years, although it feels like I've known him my whole life. We first bonded over a shared love for The Beatles, and over briefly both having a crush on the same girl in college ;).</p><p>Jeremy has an incisive wit and a very low tolerance for bullshit. He is easily the most well-read person I know, and has informed and considered views on topics ranging from politics, economics, and philosophy, to technology, architecture, and film. In all cases, our discussions are rigorous, challenging, and full of vigor. Jeremy is truly an intellectual giant.</p><p>Despite his imposing intellectual (and physical) stature, Jeremy is blessed with a rare emotional intelligence coupled with a keen self-awareness and sense of humor. Once you get to know him, he is light-hearted, sensitive, and immensely fun to be around.</p><p>Jeremy has great taste, and has introduced me to many of my favorite things: music (Rush,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5CVsCnxyXg" target="_blank">Radiohead</a>, and Paul Simon), sports (his passion for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9KbNSjQxAw" target="_blank">Ultimate Frisbee</a> is infectious), books (Neal Stephenson's amazing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age" target="_blank">speculative fiction</a>), and blogs (the essays of<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/" target="_blank">Scott Alexander</a>, which are recommended reading for all citizens of the world).</p><p>Jeremy is somewhat hamstrung by the sheer number and scope of his talents and interests; in many ways he is a victim of the tyranny of choice. The man also certainly loves his sleep :P. Having said that, Jeremy's rigorous approach to learning makes him superlative in everything he commits to. Once he chooses a career that captivates him, I'm confident his contribution will be world class.</p><p>Jeremy, my life has been hugely enriched in knowing you, and I can't wait to see what adventures and discoveries we'll make in the future. Much love.<br/></p>

<p>Luke is my younger brother and one of my best friends.Luke has always impressed me with his ability to dedicate himself to a goal, he is one of the most disciplined and self motivated people I know.</p><p>He has been gifted with exceptional intelligence and I love that he is as skeptical as he is curious, always interested that which can be proved. Though Luke is ten years my junior he is wise beyond his years and has a very strong moral core, few people are more concerned with freedom and fairness.</p><p>I love that Luke is interested in new experiences - he often deploys his vast powers of persuasion to invent wonderful and strange adventures. I know my life is better for the discoveries Luke's escapades have made possible.</p><p>Lukes friends will also agree that one of his defining characteristics is his bizarre sense of humour, one that blends black comedy, dry irony and complete absurdity. I love you boet.</p>
<p>Its difficult to give this man all the praise he deserves. His documentary <i>The Act of Killing</i> is not only one of the greatest films ever made, but also a brilliant light of truth within a society enshrouded in lies, and a powerful force of defiance against tyranny.</p><p>If that sounds like hyperbole, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD5oMxbMcHM" target="_blank">watch the film</a><br/>(I recommend the director's cut / European edition)</p><p>As a documentary filmmaker Joshua was gifted with an incredible story and unbelievable access, but what he does with that opportunity is nothing short of genius. Its worth mentioning that Joshua and his crew risked their lives to create this film, and deserve commendation for their courage and foresight.</p><p>I have little doubt that Joshuas work will have a great impact on millions of lives for decades to come. I hope that he receives all the good karma hes due.</p>
<p>I've known Christian, aka &#34;Brus&#34;, since we became teammates at the Brumbies back in 2007.</p><p>Whether slotting a sideline conversions, overcoming serious injury or leading the team through action, Christian has always been someone I've admired. He is a fierce competitor on the field, and a humble hard working teammate off it.</p><p>It has been a real pleasure to see Brussy harness his natural maturity to develop into one of the clubs senior leaders. He commands huge respect within the group because he genuinely cares about people, isn't afraid of doing the dirty work, and knows when to set aside &#34;professionalism&#34; and simply enjoy himself.</p><p>Brus, thanks for your friendship.</p><p>Rath</p>

<p>I haven't had the luck to meet Mr. Maldini in person but his way of living and public appearance despite being a soccer legend of both A.C. Milan and Italy National Team has made a huge impact in me.</p><p>He's spent his entire career (25 years) at my boyhood club when he could easily move to a more rich club with huge pay checks, but he decided to stay loyal to the team and fans. I have never seen a more polite and fair person even when in a game with tremendous pressure like a Champions League's Final.</p><p>To me he's the true meaning of loyalty and honesty and I doubt there will ever be anyone like him.</p><p>After all he will forever be my &#34;captain&#34; :)</p>
<p>I first met Albab (Bobby to his mates), a few months ago when I went with my brother to open a bank account for Karma. As we signed the relevant paperwork Dayne entered into his comedy character, this is usually enough to throw anyone, but Albab didn't miss a beat. I remember leaving that first meeting impressed, and each of the subsequent times I've been around Albab have only reinforced that feeling.</p><p>One of the things I've learnt about Albab is that he involves himself in numerous charitable causes. In the aftermath of the  Nepal earthquake Albabsetup a charity cricket match to raise aid relief funds. Following him on social media has made it clear he goes to these lengths as a matter of habit, often committing himself to important causes.</p><p>Well done, Albab.</p>
Jamie is an extremely intelligent, articulate, funny, considerate and humble guy. His only real problem is that he thinks hes a normal human. I wish hed start a cult which I could join, or that someone would give him a bunch of money so that we could all enjoy the amazing things hed create with it.
I have had the pleasure of knowing Ivan since he was Daynes mate at primary school. Ivan has been incredibly helpful and supportive of not only Dayne but also Glynis and I. Its an open secret that Ivan has worked insanely hard to establish his successful business. The hours he was working would have sunk a lessor mortal. Yet despite his workload, he did our financials and tax returns. Nothing was too much trouble and his financial advice and assistance was often laced with pearls of humour that took the edge of an otherwise serious (and boring) subject. And guess what! Ivan has never once sent us a bill! His excuse, wait until you are earning some decent dollars, like as if he himself wasnt a struggling immigrant trying to get ahead. Ivan, I just hope I live long enough to repay you
<p>When I think of Luke, I immediately think of acute testicular pain.</p><p>This isn't for no reason, when Luke was young, perhaps around 7 or 8, he had this habit of running up to me and punching me in my groin every time I walked into the Rathbone residence.</p><p>Luke was much shorter then, as most little children are. Therefore, he was able to get within striking range without detection as he come in under my line of sight, by the time I realized he was in front of me, it was too late.</p><p>Going to Dayne's house as a kid was almost like being in that movie ''screamers'', in the movie you never really see the screamer, you hear the screamer and you see the damage it does but you don't actually get a good look at the screamer. Luke was kind of like a screamer. Sometimes, I would hear Luke running around on the timber flooring in the house, I might have even have felt the vibrations his running caused through the floorboards, however, I would rarely see him until he dealt the decisive blow to my testicle. I certainly felt that pain.</p><p>Given the fact that Luke was only around 3 feet high at this time, he was able to punch at ninety degrees to my testicle, thus, exerting maximum force and causing maximum pain. He would then run away giggling whilst I stood there bewildered, buckled over, trying not to vomit... or cry.</p><p>Aside from that, Luke has turned into a fine young man and despite the fact that I no longer live near the Rathbone family, I do listen intently when Dayne speaks (highly) of Luke and his various endeavours, which include Botany (raising plants in his cupboard), cooking (mostly brownies) and working very hard at his studies.</p><p>When Luke recently visited me in Perth, I was very impressed by what a well mannered and intelligent young man Luke has become.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>One word that I would describe Vu with is: hard working, well that two words but you get the idea. I met Vu though my dear friend Anh (now his wife) about 7years ago, both of them have been my close friends since.</p><p>His action are slow and deliberate, but being slow is not his weakness, he is one of the most disciplined and methodological people I know.

I have so many more fond memories of him and I am glad to have him as a friend.</p>
Glynis is the mother of my boyfriend of nearly 5 years Rory. When it comes to people I admire she is falling right at the top of my list. Her four boys are a tribute to her strength, kindness and intelligence.

 I feel so lucky to have her in my life. It is rare that people form such a close connection to the parent in-laws (well not in-law but you get the drift),  she welcomed me into her family with open arms and spared no effort in making me feel welcomed and loved. This is not only with me but she is also kind and generous to everyone she meets regularly opening up her life and house to all of her boys wacky and zany friends.  

I truly admire her courage in moving to Australia to start her new life here. It is an incredibly brave thing for someone to do and she did it with amazing style and a kick-arse attitude to match.  It always amazes me how someone can be so strong and kind at the same time. 

If everyone in the world was more like Glyn, the world would be a fantastically beautiful place without ever getting boring.
<p>Chris is the kind of guy who'll donate an hour of time to helping someone he's never met before. I know this because an hour ago I was someone Chris had never met before.</p><p>I'd asked Chris for help with Karma's <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="">Y Combinator</a> application. Chris and his company (<a href="https://heroiclabs.com/" target="">Heroic Labs</a>) was in the last YC batch that ended just a month ago, and I thought I might learn something from his experience applying to and going through the program.</p><p>I wasn't wrong - Chris' brain is a wealth of valuable knowledge to someone in my position, which he was happy to share (with a qualification that &#34;it's all just common sense&#34;).</p><p>Thanks so much for your time Chris, and best of luck with your startup adventure!</p>

<p>I first heard about &#34;Benny A&#34; back in 2006, when it was reported to me that a young up-and-coming Brumby had broken his leg so badly many feared we would never play again.</p><p>Benny not only recovered, but has gone on to carve out an outstanding career with the Brumbies and Wallabies. Benny also strikes me assomeone perfectly matched to his job. He is deeply passionate about the teams he represents, and this enthusiasm rubs off on his teammates in spades.</p><p>The real value of rugby is in the friendships it fosters, and Benny has taken full advantage of this to form many strong bonds with his teammates and coaches.</p><p>It was a real pleasure playing alongside you, Benny, and I look forward to watching your second career, as an owner of <a href="http://www.thedockkingston.com.au" target="_blank">Canberra's primerdrinking establishment</a>, unfold.</p>
<p>Anders is a real sweetheart. He goes out of his way to help his friends and I whenever they are in need, often lending his time, technical knowledge, or equipment. By nature, he's extremely positive and upbeat nearly all the time. Which always helps to remind me that my moody feelings are just that  feelings. He enjoys the simple pleasures in life, like good food, quality time with close company, and outdoor adventures. And he's an extremely gifted emerging sound designer and music producer who is obsessed with the ins-and-outs of anything audio-related.</p><p>Anders is also extremely proactive about any personal problems he may have in his life. I'll never forget the night that an ex-roommate was screaming at him at the top of her lungs, angry about our not having purchased enough toilet paper. He yelled back, but out of desperation, offering what he could to appease her. Later that night he went out and bought so much toilet paper that it stacked up to the ceiling.</p><p>My friend Lynn has said of him  &#34;Anders is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of guy. No bullshit. Wears his heart on his sleeve.&#34; And I couldn't agree more. I would say he definitely has impacted both the world and I in a very positive way.</p>
I've only met Clyde for approximately 40 minutes face to face but he convinced me in this short space of time the positive impact Karma can have. I've always held elite athlete's in enormous regard as playing sport at that level requires talent, skill,  determination and a huge amount of hard work. I was blown away by Clyde's passion for Karma alongside Dayne and Monish. Every blog I read written by Clyde just amazes me the  written talent that he possesses. The experiences and diverse skills he brings to the Karma team will give this extremely bold idea every chance of success. Having entrepreneurs like Clyde in Australia trying to make the world a more honest, informed and accountable place gets my vote on a "positive impact"

<p>Eddy Nelson's first words to me were: &#34;So you're a funny girl, are ya?&#34; at Raw Comedy at Tilley's in 2012. She quickly became my best comedy buddy and a dear, trusted friend. To me, Eddy is always a comedian but she also happens to be many other things: a Town Planner, devoted wife and mother of four and never-endingly generous friend to all who are lucky enough to get a guernsey.</p><p>Ed is hilarious and outrageous on the one hand, deeply thoughtful and caring on the other. Even if she has four million things on (and she does, every day) she will ask if you are ok, if she can help or share some insight into how to manage a challenge.</p><p>She advocates for her children, for parents of children with autism and for women and she is an inspiration in her accomplishments in running, cycling and comedy among other talents and skills.</p><p> Eddy is a force of nature and a force for good and anyone who gets the chance to know her is better for it.<br/></p>

<p>I've know Cade since 2012 and we've become good mates over the past three years.</p><p>Cade is one of the most driven people I know.

<p>Well it is fathers day so dad's are front of mind on Karma. In life many people define success by wealth, materialism, position but for me success from the lesson's I've learnt from my dad are all about character, resilience, positive thinking, honesty and treating people how you would like to be treated.

David my wife absolutely loves you so not sure that's such a positive impact on the world at least for me (I had to go with a Karma Neutral because of this)...but I've always admired the broader impact you have made beyond sport in your philanthropic activities, the challenges you faced throughout your career and how through focus and hard work you overcame the public vilification and your willingness to continuously  change and adapt. Yes you've made mistakes as I'm sure plenty of famous sport stars have,  but its how you've dealt with them, that still earns you the respect of many. Here are  some things I've always respected.

1. Once you get hit, face it and move on. Be honest. Its all about how you handle tough situations.
2. Build your identity or personal brand - know what you stand for and build on it constantly
3. Keep working; there is always room for improvement. Beckham once stated. As a player Beckham wasn't the most skillful but he was the last to leave the training ground 
4. You only live once so make the most of it and try love what you do. When you lose your love for something, you will fall off the ladder of success. 
5. Be willing to go above and beyond. Being successful requires dedication and commitment towards your goals.

Im tempted to write horrible things about Manish so that hell be unemployable and forced to join Karma full time. But the truth is that hes incredibly intelligent, pragmatic, and kind. 
<br><br>
Manish generously helped mentor and advise Clyde and me during the early development of Karma. As an ex-Google engineer his experience and intelligence were invaluable. When our software engineer ripped us off Manish took over our development and helped us out of a very tough situation.

Spending time with Manish leaves me feeling that if society would just funnel more resources to people like him all the worlds problems would be solved within a fortnight.
<p>Clyde is my brother, one of my best friends, and my business partner. It's a good thing we get along. </p><p>Clyde's crammed more life experience into the last two decades than some people do in a lifetime. He's played sport at the highest level, travelled the world, been married and divorced, rich and broke, obese and ripped, depressed and uh... not depressed. These extremes of experience have given him a rare and invaluable perspective on life, some of which I've been fortunate enough to absorb. </p><p>Despite a decade spent smashing his head into other men, he's fiercely intelligent. He's a critical and objective thinker, an articulate speaker, and a courageous and talented writer.

<p>Jasper has been a bit of an enigma to me despite being one of my closest primates (Clyde Rathbone I've read to many of your letters!!). Growing up Jasper was a middle of the road student for many years until one day he decided to take it seriously in his final year of school. He was also, always so self assured, never needing to be part of the pack or do whatever others were doing. He was a successful DJ in school...despite to this day not knowing anything about music...Jay trust me I'm your man when it comes to music.</p><p>Then almost overnight he just turned it on and continues to do so, excelling at his final year in school, excelling at becoming a top law student, working at the top law firm, going to Cambridge, working at the top management consultancy houses internationally and an amazing financial services career spanning iconic financial institutions and hedge funds.</p><p>However behind all this is a guy that is deeply loyal, deeply spiritual and moral to the core. You will never hear Jasper celebrate his successes rather focusing on yours. He will never miss calling or thinking of you in a tough time. I have no doubt Jasper's strength is his listening skills and strategic insights. Whilst we are talking Jasper is listening. Note to self...try this a bit more!!</p><p>Jasper also set up the Link Foundation in South Africa in 1999<a href="http://www.linksa.org/home.asp" target="">http://www.linksa.org/home.asp</a>to assist previously and financially disadvantaged university students in South Africa, a wonderful initiative that has provided 120 kids education at 8 top universities in 2014 alone. Talk about a positive impact.</p><p>He is an amazing husband, father and son, less concerned about material things, but rather the quality of time and impact he can provide to his family and friends. Not one person has ever had to say a bad word about Jasper rather holding him in the utmost esteem.</p><p>I am truly blessed to have him as my best mate. I don't care that he knows more about me than I know about him because that's just Jasper and knowing he is here for me, my issues, challenges and opportunities is one of the greatest assets I have in the world.</p><p>Jay I know you are behind the scenes guy but I really wanted to provide this open letter to you on Karma as you are an inspiration to me!!</p><p><title>|Link-SA|Supporting South Africa's brightest underprivileged students</title></p><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"><tbody><tr><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Sarah. I wanted to write you a note to say thank you for your contribution to creating a healthier world. Actually, that's not true. What I really want to say is thank you for helping me recover from anorexia.</p><p>When I was on the road to recovery - around 80% of the way there - your writing led me to begin experimenting with including more fats into my diet (I was previously fat-phobic). It was the final hurdle to overcome, and your writing - debunking some of the food marketing myths, making the science accessible and being a guinea pig for us all - tipped the scales for me and I've been 100% recovered ever since. That was in 2011, and you've simply not stopped in championing change in how we consume and think about food. I thought you might be interested to learn of some of the lesser known positive outcomes of your work that extend beyond helping people quit sugar.</p><p>Keep up the great work, and again, thank you!<br/></p>
<p>Elle has also been my housemate and friend for a number of years during which time Ive gotten to know her well.</p><p>It's clear that Elle is the sister the Rathbone brothers never had, and always needed. Elle is thoughtful, warm and generous. She is incredibly well equipped to empathise with others because she is acutely sensitive to those around her.I feel immensely fortunate to have learnt much about communicate from Elle.</p><p>Elle has an amazing ability to retain a serene sense of calm amongst a Rathbone induced hurricane of madness. I appreciate the considered and dignified way she speaks her mind, it is a welcome change from the loud and aggressive gesticulations often on display around our dinner table (I'm usually the guilty party).</p><p>It's been a real pleasure watching Elle harness her many talents to grow into a confident young woman.</p>
<p>I first met Murray some years ago when we were introduced by our mutual friend, Ken Kroeger.</p><p>Murray has been an entrepreneur for decades, and this vast experience shines through every time I have the privilege of picking his brain. I cant overstate how generous Murray has been with his time. Having access to a level headed and experienced mentor has allowed Dayne and I to embraced our steep learning curve with more confidence then would otherwise be possible.</p><p>Thank you, Murray.</p>
<p>Ive only met Kevin in person once, yet hes played an important role in Karmas development.</p><p>To call Kevin a person of action would seem a gross understatement. After reading some of our blog posts Kevin contacted us, assembled a group of potential investors and arranged two pitch meetingsall in the space of a week.</p><p>Kevins support has allowed the team working on Karma to focus on building our company without being distracted by the funding issues that derail so many startups. Having worked with Kevin to secure Karmas seed funding it is clear that he values a direct and open style of communication - I appreciate this greatly. In his role as CEO of <a href="http://www.ramprfid.com" target="_blank">Ramp RFID</a> Kevin has ammassed vast experience as an entrepreneur, and Dayne and I look forward to picking his brain as we continue to develop Karma.</p><p>Kevin, thanks for believing in our team and in Karma as a concept, we look forward to repaying you by building a world class company. Cheers, Clyde<br/></p>
<p><span>Josh is helping facilitate Karmas existence, which is enough to convince me that hes having a huge positive impact on the world.</span></p><p><span>Hes one of Karmas seed investors, and whatever the opposite of a silent shareholder is. His experience in business and startups is remarkable, and hes been generously lending his time and brain to Karma - offering advice and contacts, and actively using and testing our beta (he's currently the 3rd most active writer ).</span></p><p><span>Thanks for believing in us Josh, and for helping bring Karma to life!</span></p>
<p>My sweet Tommy boy,<br/><br/>I met Tom at university and I immediately liked him because he did most of my statistic assignments for me. Over the years I have valued his company more so and I appreciate his intelligence, good nature and friendship.</p><p><span>One of Tom's greatest attributes is that he is always up for anything. He is super easy going and will rise to challenges with no complaints. He is also both a deep thinker and asceptic. Two awesome traits that complimenteach other well. Because of this I have learnt a lot from asking his opinions.</span></p><p><span>Thanks Tom, you legend.</span></p>
<p>I have been fortunate to work with George for a few years from the very beginnings of his Booodl journey. We'd never crossed paths before but from the first meeting you realise George is a high energy and enormously big thinking guy. Booodl has taken a big pivot from the beginnings of the App and is now all about making local shopping beautiful. Its a herculian task but one George approaches step by step with an unwavering belief that Booodl can change the face of Australian local shopping and then become a global business.</p><p>Check out www.booodl.com to see what it's all about.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMh89-Xh6VA" target="">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMh89-Xh6VA</a><br/></p><p>There are a few things I've learnt from George in our time working together:</p><p>1. Be ambitious, bold and believe in the dream...</p><p>2. Booodl went through a significant pivot and the speed in which they did this is very very impressive...sometimes throwing out what you have to start again is the best thing. Booodl now is on a super interesting and exciting path</p><p>3. George believes in culture. The people that work for him always comment what an amazing culture the organisation has. Culture starts from the CEO</p><p>4. Be willing to give back. George is open about the mistakes that as an entrepreneur he has made and always willing to share these with the next generation coming through</p><p>5. Be willing to have fun along the way...</p><p>When Booodl becomes a massive business I look forward to sharing the celebration with George and the team who will thoroughly deserve it!!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b id="docs-internal-guid-171a2038-d00a-82b5-8664-448daa278ffd"></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;background-color: transparent;">I met Luke at uni around 5 years ago. For the first couple of years after we met we were just acquaintances, mainly due to my own anxiousness when meeting new people. Despite my sometimes tentative nature, Luke persistently went out of his way to get to know me and include me in his life. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;background-color: transparent;">Over the past couple of years I have particularly enjoyed the small nameless moments Luke and I have spent together talking about all sorts of shared interests and unknowns. It is obvious to me that whenever Luke is interacting with someone he is genuinely seeking to learn from that person. He guides conversation toward uncovering truths in an endearing way such that, by the end of the conversation, you feel as if you have helped him improve his understanding and that you most certainly have improved yours. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;background-color: transparent;">I am fond of how Luke is always seeking new experiences. Lately, I have been exposed to numerous new activities that Luke has either recommended or organized. He also has a knack for getting shit done. It is rare to meet up with Luke without hearing about a development in some new personal project he has set himself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;background-color: transparent;">Most of all, I admire the relationships he has with his brothers and his girlfriend, Elle, of which I would describe as being filled with affection and respect. I think how he treats these people best reflects his true nature.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;background-color: transparent;">Luke is someone who challenges lifes axioms, embraces his own weirdness, has his own quirky sense of humour, and brings people together when they may not have otherwise come together. He has changed my perspective on life quite a bit. His attitude towards life has taught me to worry less, appreciate the simple things, and prioritise what I love. I look forward to many more years of friendship with this philosophical fella and many more typical Friday nights consisting of some random activity, and consuming copious amounts of strange food and average smoothies.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;background-color: transparent;">Cheers for being such a great mate Luke!</span></p>
<p>I love this guy!<br/><br/><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);float: none;background-color: rgb(249, 251, 252);">Mike is always learning and often so by seeking out extreme experiences.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: rgb(249, 251, 252);"/><br/>Mike stayed with our family while shooting the web series Dayne's World. I thoroughly enjoy his unique views of the world and universe. I learnt a lot from Mike and he has helped to broaden my perspective on many things.<br/><br/>I know Mike loves Rathbones and Rathbones love Naynas.<br/>Until next time brother!<br/><br/></p>
